If you have 12.5ml solution at 6%, how much water do you have to add to get a .5% solution



12.5 * .06 = X * .005

.75 = X * .005

150 = X

X is the final volume, but that includes the starting 12.5ml, so you have to subtract that out:

150 - 12.5 = 137.5 additional water









If you have 100 ml at 10% concentration, and you add water until you have 200ml, what % is it?

100 * 10 = 200 * D

1000 = 200 * D 

- divide both sides by 200

5 = D






If you have 100 ml at 10% concentration, and you add 200ml water, what % is it?

100 * 10 = 300 * D

1000 = 300 * D

- divide both sides by 300

3.33... = D




A * B = C * D

A is starting volume
B is the starting concentration

C is the final volume
D is the final concentration
